# Flight_Price_Prediction
This project aims to predict flight prices using advanced machine learning techniques, facilitating the optimization of travel expenses and efficient trip planning. Leveraging a dataset that includes features such as departure time, arrival time, duration, airline, source, destination, and date of journey, the project employs algorithms like linear regression and decision tree regression. Extensive hyperparameter tuning is conducted using Grid Search CV and Randomized Search CV to enhance model performance and prediction accuracy. The repository provides comprehensive resources, including scripts for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning, offering a robust framework for developing and refining flight price prediction models.
